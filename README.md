ThoughtScape
============

The purpose of this repository is two-fold.  One, I need to practice my C# skills.  Hopefully, completing this project will teach me important skill in the language, including basic back-end OO, GUI's, file management, and database access.  The second purpose is to organize my thoughts.  Any thought (a note, a to-do item, a contact, a significant URL) will be represented as a persistent data object, including display information, meta-data, and connections with other thoughts.
